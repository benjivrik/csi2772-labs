# C++ Class

These are the solutions we submitted for the labs and the final project.

I am only posting the codes we submitted. 


# Beware of Copy Pasting these codes  :D. 

I am posting the code we submitted because it was a great experience to follow this class
during the term. 

And it is was a great experience to learn the language c++.
